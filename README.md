Auxiliary learning refers to a technique used in machine learning where multiple tasks or targets are jointly learned to improve the overall performance of a model. In this approach, an auxiliary task is introduced alongside the main task, and the model is trained to predict both the main task and the auxiliary task simultaneously.

The auxiliary task is typically chosen to provide additional information or regularization to the model, aiding in the learning process of the main task. The idea behind auxiliary learning is that the shared representation learned by the model for both the main and auxiliary tasks can capture more meaningful and robust features, leading to improved generalization and performance.

By training the model to simultaneously predict the main target (i.e., 'Class') and the auxiliary targets ('Beta', 'Gamma', 'Delta'), the model can benefit from the shared representation and potentially achieve better performance on the main task compared to training with the main task alone.

One common approach in auxiliary learning is to combine the losses of the main task and the auxiliary tasks during training, with appropriate weighting or regularization. This helps to balance the influence of the main and auxiliary tasks and ensure effective joint learning.

Overall, auxiliary learning is a technique that leverages additional tasks or targets to enhance the learning process and improve the performance of a machine learning model on the main task of interest.

## Method
We have a dataset called df_greeks which includes multiple categorical features that can serve as categorical targets. We aim to train an auxiliary learning model with the main target being 'Class', and the additional categorical targets being 'Beta', 'Gamma', and 'Delta'.
To encode these categorical targets, we will employ one-hot encoding.
##Customized loss function for the auxiliary learning task
We have designed a customized loss function for the auxiliary learning task, which is a combination of two individual losses: loss1 and lamda times loss2. Here, lamda represents a weighting factor, typically set to 0.2 or another chosen value.

By incorporating both loss1 and lamda times loss2 in the loss function, we aim to balance the contributions of the main task and the auxiliary task during model training. This weighting factor allows us to adjust the relative importance of the two losses and control their influence on the overall training process.

By optimizing this loss function, we can effectively train the model to jointly learn both the main task and the auxiliary task, leveraging the benefits of auxiliary learning and potentially improving the model's performance on the desired objectives.
