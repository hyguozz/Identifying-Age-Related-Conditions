# Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. We create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). 

To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics. This project can help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.

From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.

Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases. This project works with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, a model is built to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.

# Auxiliary learning 
Auxiliary learning refers to a technique used in machine learning where multiple tasks or targets are jointly learned to improve the overall performance of a model. In this approach, an auxiliary task is introduced alongside the main task, and the model is trained to predict both the main task and the auxiliary task simultaneously.

The auxiliary task is typically chosen to provide additional information or regularization to the model, aiding in the learning process of the main task. The idea behind auxiliary learning is that the shared representation learned by the model for both the main and auxiliary tasks can capture more meaningful and robust features, leading to improved generalization and performance.

By training the model to simultaneously predict the main target (i.e., 'Class') and the auxiliary targets ('Beta', 'Gamma', 'Delta'), the model can benefit from the shared representation and potentially achieve better performance on the main task compared to training with the main task alone.

One common approach in auxiliary learning is to combine the losses of the main task and the auxiliary tasks during training, with appropriate weighting or regularization. This helps to balance the influence of the main and auxiliary tasks and ensure effective joint learning.

Overall, auxiliary learning is a technique that leverages additional tasks or targets to enhance the learning process and improve the performance of a machine learning model on the main task of interest.
# Method
We have a dataset called df_greeks which includes multiple categorical features that can serve as categorical targets. We aim to train an auxiliary learning model with the main target being 'Class', and the additional categorical targets being 'Beta', 'Gamma', and 'Delta'.
To encode these categorical targets, we will employ one-hot encoding.
##Customized loss function for the auxiliary learning task
We have designed a customized loss function for the auxiliary learning task, which is a combination of two individual losses: loss1 and lamda times loss2. Here, lamda represents a weighting factor, typically set to 0.2 or another chosen value.

By incorporating both loss1 and lamda times loss2 in the loss function, we aim to balance the contributions of the main task and the auxiliary task during model training. This weighting factor allows us to adjust the relative importance of the two losses and control their influence on the overall training process.

By optimizing this loss function, we can effectively train the model to jointly learn both the main task and the auxiliary task, leveraging the benefits of auxiliary learning and potentially improving the model's performance on the desired objectives.
